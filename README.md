# 6.111FinalProject

This was a project created in 2022 for the MIT 6.205 Digital Systems Lab course. It is designed for the Nexys A7 FPGA board to use a camera extension to take photos, manipulate them, and print them using a plotter. This was created by me, Ellie Rabenold, and Kojo Anane-Fordjour. Below is a link to our documentaation of the project
